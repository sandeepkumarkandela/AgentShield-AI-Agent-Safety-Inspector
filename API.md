# AgentShield API Reference

This document separates the currently supported automation surfaces from internal contributor modules.

## Support Levels

### Stable for users

- CLI: `agentshield scan`, `agentshield init`, `agentshield miniclaw start`
- Scanner JSON output: `agentshield scan --format json`
- MiniClaw package API: `ecc-agentshield/miniclaw`
- MiniClaw HTTP API: `/api/*` endpoints exposed by `startMiniClaw()`

### Internal for contributors

- `src/scanner/index.ts`
- `src/reporter/score.ts`
- `src/reporter/index.ts`
- `src/rules/*`

These source modules are useful inside the repository, but the npm package root export currently points to the CLI entrypoint. Treat them as implementation details unless the package exports change.

## Contributor Scanner Modules

These are the source-level entrypoints contributors use inside this repository today.

They are documented here for extension work and tests, not as stable npm import paths.

### `src/scanner/index.ts`

```ts
interface ScanResult {
  target: ScanTarget;
  findings: Finding[];
}

function scan(targetPath: string): ScanResult;
function discoverConfigFiles(targetPath: string): ScanTarget;
```

- `discoverConfigFiles()` finds Claude/AgentShield-relevant files under a target path
- `scan()` runs built-in rules against the discovered files and returns sorted findings

### `src/reporter/score.ts`

```ts
function calculateScore(result: ScanResult): SecurityReport;
```

- wraps findings with timestamp, summary counts, and numeric/category scoring

### `src/reporter/index.ts`

```ts
function renderTerminalReport(report: SecurityReport): string;
function renderJsonReport(report: SecurityReport): string;
function renderMarkdownReport(report: SecurityReport): string;
function renderHtmlReport(report: SecurityReport): string;
```

- reporters consume a `SecurityReport`
- `renderJsonReport()` returns formatted JSON text
- `renderMarkdownReport()` and `renderHtmlReport()` also expose `runtimeConfidence` when present on findings
- `renderHtmlReport()` includes an executive summary with risk posture,
  priority findings, and category exposure

## CLI API

Primary commands:

```bash
agentshield scan [options]
agentshield init
agentshield miniclaw start [options]
```

High-value `scan` options:
- `--format terminal|json|markdown|html|sarif`
- `--output <path>` for writing the selected report format to a file
- `--fix`
- `--opus`
- `--stream`
- `--injection`
- `--sandbox`
- `--taint`
- `--deep`
- `--corpus`
- `--supply-chain`
- `--supply-chain-online`
- `--policy <path>`
- `--evidence-pack <dir>`
- `--no-evidence-redact`
- `--min-severity critical|high|medium|low|info`
- `--log <path>`
- `--log-format ndjson|json`

`--corpus` runs the built-in attack corpus as a regression benchmark and
reports category coverage plus whether the gate is ready for continuous rule
hardening.

Policy preset generation:

```bash
agentshield policy init --pack enterprise --owner security@example.com
agentshield policy init --pack regulated --name "Regulated Agent Policy"
agentshield policy export --pack ci-enforcement --output-dir .github/agentshield-policies
agentshield policy promote --manifest .github/agentshield-policies/manifest.json --pack ci-enforcement --output .agentshield/policy.json
agentshield policy promote --manifest .github/agentshield-policies/manifest.json --pack ci-enforcement --dry-run --json
```

Supported packs: `oss`, `team`, `enterprise`, `regulated`,
`high-risk-hooks-mcp`, and `ci-enforcement`.

`policy promote` is checksum-first: it rejects missing manifests, unsupported
manifest schemas, ambiguous multi-pack manifests without `--pack`, tampered
policy files whose SHA-256 no longer matches the manifest, and policy files
that fail the organization policy schema. This makes exported policy bundles
usable as reviewable CI artifacts before they become the active
`.agentshield/policy.json`.

The GitHub Action exposes the same organization policy gate through the
`policy` input. It reports `policy-status` and `policy-violations` outputs,
adds policy results to the job summary, emits policy violations into SARIF as
`agentshield-policy/*` code-scanning results when SARIF output is enabled, and
fails on non-compliance by default. Set `fail-on-policy: "false"` to collect
policy evidence without failing the workflow.

The GitHub Action also exposes baseline drift through the `baseline` and
`save-baseline` inputs. It reports `baseline-path`, `baseline-status`,
`new-findings`, `resolved-findings`, `unchanged-findings`, and `score-delta`
outputs, appends a baseline drift block to the job summary, and emits
annotations for newly introduced findings. Set `fail-on-findings: "false"` when
the workflow should fail only on baseline drift instead of every current
finding.

The GitHub Action runs offline MCP package supply-chain verification by default
through the `supply-chain` input. It reports `supply-chain-status`,
`supply-chain-risky-packages`, `supply-chain-critical-count`, and
`supply-chain-high-count` outputs, appends package-risk evidence to the job
summary, and fails on critical/high package risk whenever `fail-on-findings` is
enabled. Set `fail-on-supply-chain: "false"` to collect evidence only, set it
to `"true"` to force the package-risk gate in evidence-only workflows, or enable
`supply-chain-online: "true"` to add npm registry metadata.

Policy files use schema version `1`. Enterprise policy metadata is optional but
recommended for CI gates:

- `policy_pack`: `oss`, `team`, `enterprise`, `regulated`,
  `high-risk-hooks-mcp`, or `ci-enforcement`
- `owners`: policy owner identifiers for audit and escalation
- `exceptions`: temporary rule exceptions with `id`, `rule`, `owner`,
  `reason`, `expires_at`, optional `scope`, optional `severity`, and optional
  `ticket`

Expired exceptions are reported as policy violations. Active exceptions suppress
only matching policy violations and are printed in the policy evaluation output.

Exit codes:
- `0`: scan completed without critical findings
- `1`: CLI usage error or runtime failure
- `2`: scan completed and at least one critical finding was reported

Structured scan logs:

```ts
interface ScanLogEntry {
  timestamp: string;
  level: "info" | "warn" | "error" | "debug";
  phase: string;
  message: string;
  data?: Record<string, unknown>;
}
```

## Scanner Report JSON

The supported machine-readable scanner contract today is the JSON report returned by:

```bash
agentshield scan --format json
```

Baseline comparison output is treated as auxiliary output. When JSON or SARIF is
written to stdout, baseline save/compare and gate text is written to stderr so
the primary machine-readable report remains parseable.

Scanner JSON also includes `harnessAdapters` when report generation runs through
`scan()`. This field records deterministic local marker evidence for supported
harnesses such as Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Gemini, dmux, generic terminal
agents, and project-local templates. It is local/free scan evidence only; it
does not call hosted services or require a paid/team entitlement.

Baseline snapshot creation is available as a first-class CLI command:

```bash
agentshield baseline write --path .claude --output .github/agentshield-baseline.json
```

Add `--json` to emit parseable metadata with `baselinePath`, `targetPath`,
`score`, `grade`, `findings`, and `minSeverity`.

Evidence packs are available through:

```bash
agentshield scan --evidence-pack ./agentshield-evidence
```

The evidence-pack directory is deterministic and contains `manifest.json`,
`README.md`, `agentshield-report.json`, `agentshield-report.html`,
`agentshield-results.sarif`, `policy-evaluation.json`,
`baseline-comparison.json`, `supply-chain.json`, `ci-context.json`, and
`remediation-plan.json`.
In the GitHub Action, evidence packs use the same supply-chain verification
result that powers the package-risk outputs instead of an empty placeholder.
Local path, username, email, and token-shaped string redaction is enabled by
default.

Consumers can verify and read back a saved pack:

```bash
agentshield evidence-pack verify ./agentshield-evidence --json
agentshield evidence-pack inspect ./agentshield-evidence --json
agentshield evidence-pack fleet ./repo-a-evidence ./repo-b-evidence --json
```

`inspect` verifies the bundle first, then emits score, finding counts,
runtime-confidence counts, policy status, baseline drift status, supply-chain
counts, CI provenance, and remediation workflow counts for GitHub App, Linear,
or customer-review ingestion.

`fleet` runs the same inspection across multiple evidence-pack directories and
emits totals plus route suggestions: `invalid`, `security-blocker`,
`policy-review`, `baseline-regression`, `supply-chain-review`, or `ready`.
Fleet output includes `operatorReadback.approvalIds`; each non-ready
`reviewItems[]` entry repeats its `approvalId` and exposes
`ticket.externalId` in the form `agentshield-fleet-review:<approvalId>` for
idempotent GitHub App or Linear sync.

Top-level shape:

```ts
interface SecurityReport {
  timestamp: string;
  targetPath: string;
  findings: Finding[];
  score: SecurityScore;
  summary: ReportSummary;
}
```

Finding shape:

```ts
interface Finding {
  id: string;
  severity: "critical" | "high" | "medium" | "low" | "info";
  category:
    | "secrets"
    | "permissions"
    | "hooks"
    | "mcp"
    | "agents"
    | "injection"
    | "exposure"
    | "exfiltration"
    | "misconfiguration";
  title: string;
  description: string;
  file: string;
  line?: number;
  evidence?: string;
  runtimeConfidence?:
    | "active-runtime"
    | "project-local-optional"
    | "template-example"
    | "docs-example"
    | "plugin-manifest"
    | "hook-code";
  fix?: {
    description: string;
    before: string;
    after: string;
    auto: boolean;
  };
}
```

### `runtimeConfidence`

`runtimeConfidence` is emitted when AgentShield can distinguish active runtime config from lower-confidence source kinds such as project-local settings, templates/examples, declarative manifests, and manifest-resolved non-shell hook implementations.

- `active-runtime`: active config such as `mcp.json`, `.claude/mcp.json`, `.claude.json`, or active `settings.json`
- `project-local-optional`: project-local files such as `settings.local.json`
- `template-example`: template or catalog files such as `mcp-configs/`, `config/mcp/`, or `configs/mcp/`
- `docs-example`: docs/tutorial/example config such as `docs/guide/settings.json` or `commands/*.md`
- `plugin-manifest`: declarative hook manifests such as `hooks/hooks.json`
- `hook-code`: manifest-resolved non-shell implementations such as `scripts/hooks/session-start.js`

Current caveat:
- report output now distinguishes example docs, plugin manifests, and non-shell hook implementations from active runtime findings
- scoring discounts non-secret `template-example` findings to `0.25x` and caps them at `10` deduction points per file and score category to reduce template-catalog inflation
- scoring discounts non-secret `docs-example` findings to `0.25x` to reduce example-config inflation
- scoring discounts non-secret `project-local-optional` findings to `0.75x` to reduce project-local score inflation
- scoring discounts non-secret `plugin-manifest` findings to `0.5x` to reduce declarative-manifest inflation
- `hook-code` findings currently keep full weight, but the active rules there are still narrow language-aware implementation signals
- committed real secrets still count at full weight even inside template files
- docs-only example trees now re-add the standalone `CLAUDE.md` example file for scanning, while the rest of the nested subtree stays suppressed unless a runtime companion exists
- example bundles outside the current `docs/`, `commands/`, `examples/`, `samples/`, `demo/`, `tutorial/`, `guide/`, `cookbook/`, and `playground/` path heuristics can still be treated as live config until broader example-root classification lands

Concrete examples:
- `docs-example`: `docs/guide/settings.json` or `docs/guide/CLAUDE.md` when that subtree has a runtime companion
- `plugin-manifest`: `hooks/hooks.json`
- `hook-code`: `scripts/hooks/session-start.js`

For the current false-positive and scoring follow-up queue, see [`false-positive-audit.md`](./false-positive-audit.md), especially [`Pattern Signatures In Recent Alerts`](./false-positive-audit.md#pattern-signatures-in-recent-alerts), [`Common Noisy File Archetypes`](./false-positive-audit.md#common-noisy-file-archetypes), and [`Triage Rules For Current Reports`](./false-positive-audit.md#triage-rules-for-current-reports).

## MiniClaw Package API

MiniClaw is the stable programmatic API exposed by this package today:

```ts
import {
  startMiniClaw,
  createMiniClawSession,
  routePrompt,
  createSafeWhitelist,
  createGuardedWhitelist,
  createCustomWhitelist,
  createMiniClawServer,
} from "ecc-agentshield/miniclaw";
```

High-value entrypoints:

- `startMiniClaw(config?)`: start the MiniClaw HTTP server with secure defaults
- `createMiniClawSession(config?)`: create an isolated sandbox session for embedding MiniClaw into an existing app
- `routePrompt(request, session)`: sanitize and process a prompt against a session
- `createSafeWhitelist()`, `createGuardedWhitelist()`, `createCustomWhitelist()`: build tool policy sets
- `createMiniClawServer(config)`: create a server handle without the convenience wrapper

Current packaging caveat:
- the React dashboard source exists at `src/miniclaw/dashboard.tsx`
- there is not yet a published `ecc-agentshield/miniclaw/dashboard` subpath export
- if you want the dashboard today, vendor the source component from the repository instead of importing a non-existent subpath

Core MiniClaw types are exported from `ecc-agentshield/miniclaw`, including:

- `PromptRequest`
- `PromptResponse`
- `MiniClawSession`
- `MiniClawConfig`
- `SandboxConfig`
- `SecurityEvent`

For the complete MiniClaw architecture notes, see [`src/miniclaw/README.md`](./src/miniclaw/README.md).
